**Prof-Net: A Novel Deep Learning Network for Predicting High- and Low-Profitability Tourism Firms**
This is an official implementation of **Prof Net**

1. This study includes five sectors, namely accommodation (55), food (56), travel (79), gambling (92), and sports (93)â€”according to the Nomenclature of Economic Activities (NACE Rev. 2).
2. The dataset comprises 14 different variables for each firm.
3. The repository contains five trained models for each sector with the name model_<sector_name>: e.g., model_55.pth is a trained model based on data of the firms serving in the accommodation sector.
4. Run **testing_profnet.ipynb** on your dataset for profitability prediction by changing the name of the file from **sample_data.csv** to **your csv file**.
5. The user can also choose any of the trained models present in the **models** directory.
